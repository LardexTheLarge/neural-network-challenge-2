## Introduction

In this project, we aim to create a neural network capable of predicting two key aspects of employee management: attrition likelihood and department fit. The HR department has expressed the need for a predictive model that can identify employees at risk of leaving the company and suggest suitable departments for potential reassignment.

## Features

- Attrition Prediction: Develop a neural network model to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company based on various features such as job satisfaction, salary, performance ratings, etc.
- Department Prediction: Implement a branched neural network architecture to simultaneously predict the likelihood of attrition and the department that best fits each employee. This approach allows for efficient utilization of shared features while capturing the distinct characteristics of each prediction task.
- Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering to preprocess and transform the input data, ensuring that the neural network receives relevant and meaningful information for accurate predictions.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the neural network using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in predicting both attrition and department fit.
